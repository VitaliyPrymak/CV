# Resume Project

## Overview
This repository contains my practice project where I learned to build a resume using HTML and CSS. While I have since shifted my focus to DevOps, this project helped me understand web page structure, semantic elements, and basic styling. It was a great starting point before diving into infrastructure and automation.

## Project Structure
```
resume-project/
├── css/                # Stylesheet for the resume
│   ├── style.css       # Main CSS file
├── images/             # Images used in the resume
│   ├── photo.jpg       # Profile picture (JPG format)
│   ├── photo.webp      # Profile picture (WebP format)
├── index.html          # Main HTML file containing resume content
```

## Features
- **HTML5 structure**: Proper use of semantic elements for better accessibility.
- **CSS styling**: Basic styling to improve visual presentation.
- **Responsive design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes for a better user experience.

## How to View the Resume
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-project.git
   cd resume-project
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.

## Future Improvements
Although I have moved into DevOps, potential improvements could include:
- Adding a contact form using JavaScript.
- Implementing a dark mode toggle.
- Enhancing styles with CSS animations.
